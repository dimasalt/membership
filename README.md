# Better Life Membership #

A membership website to serve members with programs they have paid for.
Created with the use of Slim PHP framework and Swift Mailer packages.

The application moved to beta tests and had main functionality done, but still, lacks many futures that will be developed in future...

## Priority TO DO LIST ##

**- Add transaction ban list and conditions to reject the repeated refund offenders**


**- Redesign website**


## TO DO LIST ##

### Development elements that need to be done ###
* Create an **admin promotion page**
* Create **Admin program pages** (programs, categories, items, upload files)
* Create **SEO admin page** for the website main page (should include description, a title, and keywords) and sales pages
* Develop **admin members management page** where admin can manage users. Create, Modify and assign
* Add **UPSELL** to the sales page (person buys one program and offered another one as well for reduced price)


### Ideas ###
* Add comments to items and programs
* Add pages with special membership content (Videos, articles etc...)
* Think about adding forum
* Think about adding life support chat option
* Think about adding appointment page
* Think about adding membership news (global and for specific program)

### Possible Payments Integrations ###

* JVZoo Integration
* ClickBank Integration
* Braintree Integration



NOTE: The Payment Notification System should not only work for payments, but also take care of refunds, chargebacks, and other payments statuses. It should also be able to add a person to a membership website and to CRM upon payment or remove him from there if refund or chargeback has been issued.
