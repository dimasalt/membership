                    <h3>Ending The Nightmare</h3>

                    <img src="/assets/images/meditation%20sales%20page/women_in_field.png" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive pull-right margin-left-25" style="width: 35%;" />

                    <p>Growing up Jenn always knew she was different. She lived with her sister and mother and her parents were divorced. Her father left one day and never came back.</p>

                    <p>She would later discover that her anxiety attacks were triggered by abandonment.</p>

                    <p>On the outside, she was an excellent student with good grades, a talent for music and always with a smile on her face.</p>

                    <p>But on the inside she feared to be alone, unwanted, unpopular and unloved and felt trapped in a nightmare that would never end.</p>

                    <p>Her first anxiety attack happened in a 9th grade. A teacher has asked her to come in front and make a small presentation.</p>

                    <p>Simple enough…</p>

                    <p>But the moment she came to the front a panic attack hit her. She started shaking, feel nauseous and sweating from head to toe.</p>

                    <p>She wanted to run, but couldn't.</p>

                    <p>At times when she felt fine, she wondered when her next anxiety attack would hit her. Constant worrying and panicking barely left her
                        any strength to go through the day.</p>

                    <p>Her mother tried everything she could to help her…</p>

                    <p>She went to a therapist, took a cocktail of multiple medications and even took habit forming classes.</p>

                    <p>But this all only made her feel like a zombie moving through the life.</p>
                    <p>By the age of 16, she was completely shut socially. Her peers went to parties, played sport and started dating. But she was a prisoner in her own home.</p>

                    <p>She barely managed to finish the high school. But when she went to college her anxiety became so unbearable that she had to drop out.</p>

                    <p>Then one morning her wake-up call came in.</p>

                    <p>She was reading a newspaper; it was an article on meditation. The article described what meditation is, and how it can help people.</p>

                    <p>She decided to give it a try.</p>

                    <p>Over the next few months, she got every book and product on meditation she could lay her hands on.</p>

                    <p>It took her a year, but by the end of this year she was anxiety free, and the nightmare was over.</p>

                    <p>Today her life is completely different, she got back and graduated college and is planning to marry her fiancé and looking forward buying her first house.</p>

                    <p>She beliefs she got lucky on that faithful morning to find a solution to escape her nightmare.</p>

                    <h3>A Secret That Makes Meditation One of The Most Effective Tools For Anxiety And For Panic Attacks</h3>

                    <img src="/assets/images/meditation%20sales%20page/The-Power-of-Concentration.jpg" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive pull-left margin-right-25" style="width: 35%;" />

                    <p>Life offers no magic bullets; we all know that.</p>
                    <p>But if there is one thing that comes close to it, then it is meditation.</p>
                    <p>Not only meditation can heal your long term anxiety, but it can also remove all the negativity you have acquired over the time as a result of anxiety.</p>
                    <p>With meditation, you can remove the root cause for your anxiety, and also remove negative feelings and emotions, self-defeating beliefs, internal personality conflicts and negative behavior patterns.</p>
                    <p><strong>It is a powerful tool, and if you struggle with anxiety, you should learn to use it.</strong></p>
                    <p>Because it will bring light back to your life.</p>
                    <p>The reason meditation is so efficient and powerful is because it gives you full control over your mind.</p>
                    <p>With meditation, you literally can walk into your mind and rearrange or change the things you want.</p>
                    <p>This means that if you have any other issues you struggle with, physical, emotional or mental you can use meditation to solve them as well.</p>

                    <h3>A Number One Reason Why Meditation Becoming So Popular And People Cannot Stop Praising It Enough</h3>

                    <p>There is a reason why meditation is so popular with people singing praises to it and cannot get enough of it.</p>
                    <p>Because it is <strong>a life changer.</strong></p>
                    <p>In fact, meditation been getting so much attention and popularity that some of the very prominent world institutions came out with their own research on it.</p>
                    <p>Like two years ago, University of Toronto (ranked 7th in the world) came out with research with very positive results on how mindfulness meditation is very effective for anxiety.</p>
                    <p>I know it firsthand because I have met the researcher and took a workshop with him.</p>
                    <p>In fact, I am going to share with you the exact mindfulness meditation technique that they have used in their research so effectively.</p>
                    <p>But here is what even more interesting…</p>
                    <p>Traditional therapists who usually stay away from alternative methods nowadays start to suggest meditation to their patients who struggle with anxiety, panic attacks, and depression.</p>
                    <p>And it is happening in sweeping numbers.</p>
                    <p>Even they cannot keep their eyes closed and deny the overwhelming evidence on how powerful and effective meditation is.</p>
                    <p>But, to use meditation for anxiety, you have to learn it the right way.</p>


                    <h3>Why You Almost Guaranteed to Fail to Learn Meditation And How to Fix it</h3>
                    <img src="/assets/images/meditation%20sales%20page/women-meditating.png" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive pull-right margin-left-25" style="width: 35%;" />

                    <p>If you just starting with meditation or don&rsquo;t have enough experience you are almost guaranteed to fail to learn meditation.</p>
                    <p>This is because most of the advice out there is a casual, sparkly and a new-age advice.</p>
                    <p>Advice that makes total sense but wrong at its core.</p>
                    <p>And if you follow it, it will lead you down to a path of failure, frustration, and regret.</p>
                    <p>Things that you already have plenty because of anxiety or panic attacks.</p>
                    <p>I am talking here about advice such as &ldquo;to meditate just sit down, close your eyes and concentrate on something.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>Very wrong!</p>
                    <p>Here, ask yourself if any concentration in your life ever led to meditation?</p>
                    <p>When you studied at school and concentrated on homework did it ever lead to meditation?</p>
                    <p>When you are busy and fully concentrated at work did it ever lead to meditation?</p>
                    <p>When you are reading an interesting book and fully engaged in the process to the point of forgetting about anything around you. Did it ever lead to meditation?</p>
                    <p>I can continue and give you more examples, but the answer to all of them would be NO.</p>

                    <p>In fact, never before in your life no concentration ever led you to meditation. Or for that matter to any state of mind that can change your life entirely.</p>
                    <p>This is because to reach meditation it takes a very specific concentration done in a very specific way.</p>
                    <span class="highlight2"><u>So how would you go about learning meditation?</u></span>
                    <p>The answer is simple.</p>

                    <img src="/assets/images/meditation%20sales%20page/lotus.png" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive pull-left margin-top-20 margin-right-25" style="width: 35%;" />
                    <p><strong>It&rsquo;s called a traditional yoga meditation</strong>.</p>
                    <p>You see, yoga and meditation been around for 5000 years. Meaning it had 500 centuries to develop and perfect a system to learn and practice meditation.</p>
                    <p>And this traditional system been tested by billions of people and been proven to work exceptionally well.</p>
                    <p>You see, no matter what other people may tell you, meditation is a pinnacle of almost any yoga system. Even big gurus of physically centered yoga systems admit that without meditation their system is only as half as good.</p>
                    <p>Given that, can anyone really think that to meditate all you need is just sit down and concentrate?</p>
                    <p>No way! Unless of course you already mastered the art.</p>
                    <p><strong>That&rsquo;s why the traditional yoga meditation developed a gradual step-by-step system that allows you quickly and surely learn meditation. And no new-age advice will ever come close to it</strong>.</p>
                    <p>The new-age advice may look logical; it may look convincing, it may make total sense, but it is impractical and in the long run going only to harm you.</p>
          
                    <p>Which brings me to the next important point</p>
